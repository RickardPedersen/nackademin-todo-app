This data can be used to customize content and functionality in our services to improve your user experience. The local storage of data can be done with cookies, session storage or local storage.\r\n\r\n- A cookie is a small text file that the website requires to save locally on your computer. This cookie helps us recognize your browser and can for example, tell us if you are logged in or have made any specific settings.\r\n\r\n- Local storage is another way for websites to save the same type of data locally in your browser. A difference from cookies is that local storage is not automatically sent to the server with every request.\r\n\r\n- The difference between session storage and local storage is that session storage is removed immediately when you close your browser.\r\n\r\n## How do we use cookies and local storage of data?\r\nCookies and local storage are used to improve the functionality on our website and ensure that our services work the way they should.\r\n\r\n- **Log in and settings.** We save a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/) in your local storage so that you don't have to log in every time you visit our website. This token contains your user id, username and role.\r\n\r\n## How can you manage your cookies and local storage?\r\nYou can at any time remove cookies and local storage in your browser settings and change how local information can be stored.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to disable cookies and local storage that could mean some of our services will not work properly. Log in and settings will not be saved.\r\n\r\n- **Log Out** When you log out from our website, the [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io/) will be removed from your local storage.\r\n",i={data(){return{markdown:n}},components:{QMarkdown:s["a"]},methods:{cookieAccept(){localStorage.setItem("cookiePolicyAccepted",!0)},cookieDecline(){localStorage.removeItem("userToken"),localStorage.removeItem("cookiePolicyAccepted")}}},c=i,l=(t("8b3d"),t("2877")),u=t("9c40"),d=t("eebe"),m=t.n(d),y=Object(l["a"])(c,a,r,!1,null,null,null);o["default"]=y.exports;m()(y,"components",{QBtn:u["a"]})}}]);
